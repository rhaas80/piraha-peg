Piraha is a [Parsing Expression Grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar) library written in Java

The name comes from the spoken language called [Pirah√£](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirah%C3%A3_language), which by some measure is
considered the simplest language in the world.

The syntax is loosely based on regular expressions as they are found in Perl or Java.
The Reference link below provides a detailed description of the pattern elements. The
Quick Start describes how to use the API. See the Calculator and CSscript examples to
get a more detailed idea on how to write programs with Piraha.
