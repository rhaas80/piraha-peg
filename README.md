# piraha-peg
Parsing expression grammar library written in Java

The syntax is loosely based on regular expressions as they are found in Perl or Java.
The Reference link below provides a detailed description of the pattern elements. The
Quick Start describes how to use the API. See the Calculator and CSscript examples to
get a more detailed idea on how to write programs with Piraha.
